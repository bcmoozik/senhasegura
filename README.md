# senhasegura
This repository will start as a simple command line tool to interact with API data with SenhaSegura A2A API.
The initial commit supports the ability to pull username and password (credentials) for a specific account in Senhasegura
PAM. Will add other API functionality at a later date.

TODO:
- Break this simple file out into packages and modules.
- Add ability to get list of accounts
- other valuable API functionality
